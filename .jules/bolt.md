## 2026-07-01 - [O(1) Node Lookup in EvidenceBoard]
**Learning:** O(N) array lookups within frequent render cycles (like drag operations) cause massive performance bottlenecks.
**Action:** Use `useMemo` with a Map to transform O(N) operations into O(1) lookups during frequent re-renders.

## 2026-07-01 - [O(1) Task Lookup in CaseBoard]
**Learning:** O(N) array filtering within render loops (like rendering drag-and-drop columns) causes massive performance bottlenecks, especially when the same filter is applied multiple times for counting and mapping.
**Action:** Use `useMemo` to group elements in O(N) time once per state change, allowing for O(1) lookups during render phases and avoiding repeated filtering.
## 2026-07-05 - [React.memo missing on heavy markdown lists]
**Learning:** Rendering complex markdown in a list without `React.memo` combined with a fast-changing state like an input field causes massive lag, because typing triggers a full re-parse and re-render of the entire chat history.
**Action:** Extract list items that do heavy rendering (like markdown parsing) into their own component and wrap them with `React.memo`. Ensure props like callbacks are wrapped in `React.useCallback` in the parent so they don't break memoization.

## 2026-07-08 - [ReactMarkdown Re-mounting with Inline Components]
**Learning:** Passing an inline object with inline functions to the `components` prop of `ReactMarkdown` causes React to completely unmount and remount all markdown elements on every render (because the component references change). Even inside a `React.memo` component, inline `components` objects cause remounting on every render of the memoized component.
**Action:** Always extract the `components` object and its custom renderers outside the component body as a module-scope constant so their references remain stable across all renders.
